# Data attached to our last paper entitled : An improved PSD method combined with SVM algorithm for Electromechanical fault detection
In this Github repo, we provide several datasets that could be used to reproduce the results presented in our work. All datasets have been preprocessed and they were stored as .mat files.
This repository contains three documents named Data_NH1, Data_NH2 and Data_NH3 respectively. The number in front of the names indicates how many hramonic defects were used to produce the data and results. Each file contains 4 categories of data: PSD, SPSD, PCA and SPCA. The figures are named as follows: Figure....psd/spsd/pca/spca. Figure....pca means the combination of pca, psd and svm and Figure....spca means the combination of pca, spsd and svm. psd is the power spectral density and spsd, the square of the power spectral density.The data is named as follows: DataXpsd/spsd/pca/spcaY. DataXpcaY means the combination of pca, psd and svm and DataXspcaY means the combination of pca, spsd and svm.psd is the power spectral density and spsd, the square of the power spectral density. X indicates the number of fault harmonics used and Y indicates whether the machine is healthy (0) or suffering from one of the four other faults (1 to 4).
